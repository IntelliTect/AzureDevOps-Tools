# git and TFS Branches Compared

TFS and git branches are very different:

TFS
- branches are "expensive"
- create a complete copy of the folder from which they are created
- can apply at a folder level
- branch at the last possible/responsible moment, or
- use fixed branches

git
- git branches are simply a pointer
- differences are maintained in git commits
- git branches apply to an entire repo
- branch as default way to do development
