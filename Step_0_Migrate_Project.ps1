      In batches where Created Date Between
             0 -  100
           100 -  200 
           200 -  300 
           300 -  400 
           400 -  500

           800 -  900
           900 - 1000
          1000 - 1100
          1100 - 1200

          1500 - 3000
          3000 +     

    Since the Azure REST API for work items has a query limit if 20,000, calls to the API have been broken up into batches based on the Work item's Created Date field 
    Each batch is listed below with the expected work item count to be migrated. The work item counts may vary since the work items are being updated daily.
